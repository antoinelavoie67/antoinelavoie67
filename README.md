ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Antoine Lavoie
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things computer science and data science! Currently, I am looking to work with large data sets where I can use probabilistic/ML models, Pandas, and other tools to derive important takeaways.
ðŸŒ± On my GitHub you will find side projects that I have been working on alongside school work. More specifically you can find WebScrapers that I have leveraged to create meaningful recommendations for companies I consult for, as well as some of my work in the IOS mobile development space using Swift.
